# ki-repo

Repository for storing packages and metadata.

note: Currently Ki is not ready for any kind of use.

# Plan

1. Local repository features: create package, import, export, list, test, dependencies
2. Metadata support: statuses, file tagging
3. Repository cleanup and removal
4. Use script files in repository to add additional commands to ki

Once these features are implemented Ki is ready for use on local server. In the future, the goal is to provide tools
to manage distributed repositories: downloads and replication.
